# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple application that automatically post-processes MP3 files to add missing ID3 tags (specifically genre and year) without modifying any other existing metadata. The application will scan MP3 files in the ~/Music directory and ensure they have the required ID3 tags populated.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music library owner, I want an automated process to add missing genre and year ID3 tags to my MP3 files, so that my music collection has consistent metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL scan all MP3 files in the ~/Music directory
2. WHEN an MP3 file is missing a genre tag THEN the system SHALL add a default or inferred genre tag
3. WHEN an MP3 file is missing a year tag THEN the system SHALL add a default or inferred year tag
4. WHEN processing MP3 files THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing ID3 tags and metadata
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of files processed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be safe and non-destructive, so that my original music files are never corrupted or lose existing metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any MP3 file THEN the system SHALL NOT modify existing ID3 tags
2. WHEN processing any MP3 file THEN the system SHALL NOT alter the audio content
3. WHEN an error occurs during processing THEN the system SHALL skip the problematic file and continue
4. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL create backups or use safe write operations
5. IF a file cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control how missing tags are populated, so that the metadata added is meaningful and appropriate for my collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to add a genre tag THEN the system SHALL use a configurable default genre value
2. WHEN the system needs to add a year tag THEN the system SHALL use a configurable default year value
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of default values
4. IF no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use reasonable defaults (e.g., "Unknown" for genre, current year for year)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see what the application is doing, so that I can monitor progress and verify the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL display progress information
2. WHEN processing each file THEN the system SHALL show which file is being processed
3. WHEN tags are added THEN the system SHALL report what tags were added to which files
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary of total files processed and tags added
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be easy to run, so that I can execute it whenever needed without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to run the application THEN the system SHALL provide a simple command-line interface
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically find MP3 files in ~/Music
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL handle subdirectories within ~/Music
4. IF the ~/Music directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message
5. WHEN the application completes THEN the system SHALL exit cleanly with appropriate status codes
